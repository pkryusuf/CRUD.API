# Dynamic Object API

## Overview

This project is a **Dynamic Object API** built using **.NET Core** and **Entity Framework**, which allows users to create, read, update, and delete dynamic objects such as `Products`, `Customers`, `Orders`, etc. All the object types share a single central table, and the API supports transaction management for master objects and their related sub-objects.

## Features

### 1. Dynamic Object Creation
- Create any type of object (e.g., `Product`, `Customer`, `Order`) with flexible fields.
- Objects are stored in a dynamic format, allowing for future expansion without the need for additional database tables.

### 2. CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Dynamically add new objects and define their structure.
- **Read**: Retrieve objects based on type and ID, with optional filters.
- **Update**: Modify existing objects dynamically.
- **Delete**: Remove an object along with its sub-objects in a single operation.

### 3. Transaction Management
- Transactions ensure that all related objects (master and sub-objects) are created, updated, or deleted together.
- If any part of a transaction fails, the entire operation is rolled back.

### 4. Dynamic Field Validation
- Each object type (e.g., `Product`, `Customer`) requires certain fields (`ProductId`, `Name`, etc.).
- Validation ensures that required fields are present before processing.
